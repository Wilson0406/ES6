# ES6+

```This repo contains the most modern features of JavaScript, also known as ES6+. ES6 is short for ECMAScript 6, and the plus sign (+) signals that we're also including features from even newer versions of ECMAScript.```

JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Itâ€™s used almost everywhere: from large-scale web applications to complex servers to mobile and even in IoT devices.

## What is the ES6?
ECMAScript 6 (ES6 for short) is the sixth edition of the ECMA-262 standard and features major changes and improvements to the ECMAScript specification.

## What's the difference between ECMAScript and JavaScript?
ECMA means European Computer Manufacturer's Association. ECMAScript is a programming language standard and JavaScript is its implementation. ECMAScript specifies the core features that a language should provide and how those features should be implemented. JavaScript was originally created at Netscape, and they wanted to standardize the language. So, they submitted the language to the European Computer Manufacturer's Association (ECMA) for standardization. But there were trademark issues with the name JavaScript, and the standard became called ECMAScript, which is the name it holds today as well.

## Is vanilla ES6 JavaScript?
Vanilla Javascript is another way of saying 'plain Javascript'. ES6 is a set of language features of Javascript.

## What is the difference between ES6 and ES5?
ES6 (ECMAScript 6) is the next edition of the ECMA-262 standard. It improves the previous edition and adds some new syntax and functionality. Most of the improvements are covered in the course, so dive straight in to discover the differences.
