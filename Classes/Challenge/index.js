/*

**Classes Challenge**:

Create a class Player with the following:
- Add a Name and Country properties
- Add a function that when it runs should print into the console ("Messi was born in Argentina");
- Make sure to adapt this function to receive dynamic Names and Clubs.

Create a Subclass called TennisPlayer that extends from the class Player
- Add a new property Age.
- Add a function that when it runs should print into the console something similar ("Rafael Nadal is 34 years old and knows how to play Tennis");
- Make sure the Name and Age are dynamic.
